    "description": "  Access to improved sanitation and source of drinking water is essential in reducing cases of stunting and diarrhea.\nOther benefits of access to improved sources of water and sanitation are: time saving, school attendance, and\nreduction in violence and stress.  According to WHO, 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water\nservices and 4.2 billion people lack safely managed sanitation services.\nWater and sanitation data is reported at predefined geographic areas, mostly admin level 2.\nHeterogeneity within the geographic region is typically hidden from the policy makers.\nThe objective of the water and sanitation model is to predict the percentage of households\nthat have access to unimproved sanitation and source of drinking water at pixel level.\nOur hypothesis is that areas where people don't have access to improved sanitation and\nsource of drinking water share spectral traits that make them distinguishable from areas with\nimproved sanitation and source of drinking water when viewed from above.\n\nNote: This model can be run for the countries of Ethiopia, Djibouti, and South Sudan. Model for Djibouti was trained using data from both Ethiopia and Djibouti.",
